# SamplePortfolio
Some of the codes that I wrote for various occasions. Can be freely used and distributed. 

Most of the codes here are gotten from various pages on the Internet, mostly stackoverflow.com. Therefore I claim no ownership for the files and codes in this repo. If you think that I need to give credit to some particular person for the codes in this repo, please let me know. Some of the codes may contain some ingenuity coincidentally, which are for sure the result of all the amazing work of other great people. What I did is to bring them together to work on some patricular case. Many thanks to all of them.

I am not coming fom a coder background. What I got here is partly learned from some introductory college courses and partly self taught. So I mostly sure did not follow coding conventions, rule of thumbs, etc. Things here worked for me in ad-hoc cases, but also can give some insights about what can be done for some specific problems.

Thanks for reading. Please feel free to contact me for whatever reason you have.
